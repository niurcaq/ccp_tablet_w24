            <h2 id="chicago">My Hometown</h2>
            <p>
                I have four siblings, an older brother, a younger brother, and two younger twin sisters. I love them a lot! We were all born in the best 
                city of America, Chicago. Chicago is a major city in Illinois full of diversity and amazing places to check out! It has some of the best 
                food in America. It also has a great transportation system that can take you anywhere across the city in minutes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some of my favorite activities to do are visting the Shedd Aquarium, the Museum of Science & Industry, the Willis Tower, shopping at 
                Block 37, and enjoying the beach. But there are a ton of other activities to do such as boat tours that explain Chicago's architecture 
                and history, visiting the Planeterium, the Art museums, and enjoying the beautiful city lights at night!

            <h2 id="mexico">My Heritage</h2>
            <p>
                My parents were born in Mexico. So I'm proud to be a Mexican-American! I absolutely adore Mexico and would recommend anyone to go and visit. 
                Mexico has some of the best hospitatlity from anyone. Not only does Mexico have beautiful weather, it has exquisite food, and stunning views.
                Some places I would recommend to visit are Cancun, Puerto Vallarta, Mexico City, and Guadalajara. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Cancun and Puerto Vallarta are some of the most common tourist spots with beautiful beaches and views that can't be explained. Mexico city, 
                La cuidad de Mexico, is the capital of Mexico. It's a great place to visit and learn more about Mexico! Guadalajara is one of the best cities 
                to visit in Jalisco, other than Puerto Vallarta. It has beautiful farm lands, mountain views, and a huge elegant mall. Mexico is a great place 
                to vacation as the US dollar is worth about 18 pesos in Mexico. As refernce, my family is made up of 7 people, so a family takeout meal can go 
                anywhere from eighty five to a hundred twenty dollars. However, in Mexico I was able to buy my entire family a fulfilling meal and dessert for 
                twenty five dollars.

            <h2 id="college">My College and Career</h2>
            <p>
                Currently, I'm attending the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. I really love this University! I think one of the best things this college offers
                is the amount of resources for our careers. Career fair is one of the biggest opportunities I don't always see at other colleges. The fact that
                this campus is so huge and has a ton of students means that you work tons of different people and there are so many organizations and groups you
                can join.  
            </p>
            <p>
                I absolutely love developing code that can be used for real-world problems. Ever since I was young, I knew that coding and computers
                were my thing. I came to this school without any knowledge of how to code and although there were times where I struggled, I made it through and
                have learned so much. That's why I'm proud to have chosen CS, Computer Science, as my major.
            </p>

            <h2 id="dogs">My Favorite Animals</h2>
            <p>
                I love animals so much. They're just so cute and adorable! My favorite animal is a dog because they're just so cute. Dogs are so loyal and 
                a great companion to have. I also love cats and think they're so cute and funny. As any other person, I love to watch a lot of cat videos.
                Some of my favorite dog breeds include Golden Retrievers, German Shephards, Dobermans, Rottweilers, Shiba Inus, and Dachshunds. But I love
                all cute adorable dogs.  
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2 id="food">My Favorite Food</h2>
            <p>
                I think Mexican food is the best food ever invented. Some of my favorite Mexican dishes include pozole, mole, pipian, chiles rellenos, 
                camarones a la diabla, tortas de camaron, ceviche, tacos de carne asada, sopes, enchiladas, quesadillas, elotes, and so many more!
                Some of my favorite drinks are agua de pina, agua de sandia, agua de pepino, horchata, jamaica, agua de fresa, and agua de tamarindo.
                There are so many delicious dishes and drinks all around Mexico that are fantastic!
